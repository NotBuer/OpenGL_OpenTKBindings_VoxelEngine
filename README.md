# OpenGL_OpenTKBindings_VoxelEngine
All OpenGL back-end stuff, using OpentTK, creating a voxel engine.

Starting with the simple basic drawing function, shaders, transformation, camera projection matrix (Perspective & Orthographic), lighting, materials, lighting maps, light casters.

Implementing all of it in the purpose to create a infinite procedural generated voxel world, and also to use to create some engine tools to allow easier development process.
